# Phishing Simulation Using Gophish on Kali Linux

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Gophish**, an open-source phishing toolkit, to simulate phishing attacks for cybersecurity awareness training. The objective is to understand social engineering tactics and implement phishing defenses.

## Tools Used
- **Kali Linux** (for ethical hacking)
- **Gophish** (phishing simulation toolkit)
- **Email Server** (for sending phishing emails)
- **Web Server** (to host fake phishing pages)

## Key Tasks
- Setting up **Gophish** to launch phishing campaigns
- Creating **custom phishing email templates**
- Designing **fake login pages** for credential harvesting
- Analyzing **attack results** to measure user awareness
- Implementing **defensive strategies** against phishing

## How to Run
1. Download Gophish:
   ```sh
   wget https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/download/vX.X.X/gophish-vX.X.X-linux-64bit.tar.gz
